Arduino Sketches
================

This `arduino/` directory contains various Arduino sketches (`.ino` files)
for interacting with the transparent-display project.

 - ArduinoReadUSB - proof of concept for serial communication with Python on the other end
 - attic/CFAL12856A00151B - demonstration project from Crystalfontz
 - attic/testTOLED - transparent OLED test that adds a few custom images to the CF project, above

Projects in the `arduino/attic/` folder are not the subject of current work,
but are kept around as reference material.
